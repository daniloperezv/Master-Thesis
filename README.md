# Master-Thesis: Intertemporal and Heterogeneous Effects of Lockdown Mandates on Violent Crime in Chile

This thesis studies dynamic impacts on violent crime of lockdown imposition and removal during the COVID-19 pandemic across Chile's 346 municipalities. I provide estimates of dynamic impacts of lockdown entry and exit on five variables of violent crime, and explicitly explore the mechanisms behind this relationship. Estimates show an expected negative sign when lockdown is imposed and positive sign when the lockdown is lifted. The reduction of violent crime due to lockdown entry was predominantly larger during the first wave. The changes in violent crime trends during the COVID-19 lockdowns seem to be aligned with changes in mobility due to the restriction on social interactions and the increase of criminalsâ€™ search costs of potential victims. Lockdown imposition is associated with a decrease in employment during the first COVID-19 wave. However, an extended analysis reveals that unemployment may not be a mechanism through which lockdown impacted violent crime in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic.
